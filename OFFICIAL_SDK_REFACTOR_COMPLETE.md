# Official MCP SDK Refactoring Complete

## Summary

The kasm-mcp-server-v2 codebase has been successfully refactored to use the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK instead of a custom implementation.

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `mcp>=1.0.0` to requirements.txt (the official SDK from PyPI)
- Removed references to non-existent `mcp-python` package

### 2. Server Implementation
- Completely rewrote `src/server.py` to use FastMCP from the official SDK
- All tools are now defined using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator pattern
- Simplified the overall architecture significantly

### 3. Removed Files
- Deleted `src/mcp_server.py` (custom MCP implementation)
- Deleted `src/tools/base.py` (custom base class)
- Deleted `src/tools/command.py`, `session.py`, `admin.py` (individual tool files)
- All tools are now defined directly in `server.py`

### 4. Improved Structure
- Tools are defined as simple decorated async functions
- No need for complex class hierarchies
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Benefits of Using Official SDK

1. **Simplicity**: The FastMCP interface is much simpler than implementing JSON-RPC manually
2. **Reliability**: Official SDK is maintained by the MCP team
3. **Compatibility**: Guaranteed compatibility with MCP clients
4. **Features**: Access to all MCP features (tools, resources, prompts, etc.)
5. **Documentation**: Official documentation and examples available

## Tools Available

The server now exposes the following tools via the MCP protocol:

### Command Execution
- `execute_kasm_command` - Execute commands in a Kasm session with security validation

### Session Management
- `create_kasm_session` - Create a new Kasm workspace session
- `destroy_kasm_session` - Terminate an existing session
- `get_session_status` - Get status of a session

### File Operations
- `read_kasm_file` - Read files from a Kasm session
- `write_kasm_file` - Write files to a Kasm session

### Admin Tools
- `get_available_workspaces` - List available workspace images
- `get_kasm_users` - List Kasm users
- `create_kasm_user` - Create new Kasm users

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Kasm API credentials
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python -m src
   ```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all imports:
```bash
python3 test_imports.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the server with an MCP client (like Cline)
2. Add more tools as needed
3. Implement MCP resources for read-only data
4. Add MCP prompts for common workflows

The refactoring is complete and the server is ready for use with the official MCP Python SDK!
