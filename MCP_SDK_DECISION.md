# MCP SDK Decision: Using the Official Python SDK

## Discovery

After investigating the import issues, I discovered that:

1. The original code was trying to import from `mcp_python` which doesn't exist
2. There IS an official MCP Python SDK available at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
3. The official SDK is published on PyPI as `mcp` (not `mcp_python`)
4. It can be installed with: `pip install mcp`

## Decision

**We should refactor the code to use the official MCP Python SDK** instead of the custom implementation I created.

### Reasons:

1. **Official Support**: Using the official SDK ensures compatibility with the MCP protocol
2. **Maintenance**: The official SDK will be maintained by the MCP team
3. **Features**: The official SDK likely has more features and better error handling
4. **Standards**: Following the official implementation ensures we're following best practices
5. **Simplicity**: The FastMCP interface is much simpler than implementing JSON-RPC manually

### What needs to change:

1. Update `requirements.txt` to use `mcp` instead of removing it
2. Refactor the server to use FastMCP from the official SDK
3. Update tool implementations to use the decorator pattern
4. Remove the custom MCP server implementation
5. Simplify the overall code structure

## Next Steps

1. Update requirements.txt to include `mcp`
2. Refactor server.py to use FastMCP
3. Update all tool files to use the decorator pattern
4. Remove unnecessary custom implementations
5. Test the refactored code
